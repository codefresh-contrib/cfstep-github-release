# GitHub release Codefresh Plugin

A quick plugin to cover specific use case: create releases in GitHub and upload files for them. The plugin also allows to do more complex actions overriding the command manually.

## Basic usage

This example creates a release and uploads files to it:

```
github_prerelease:
        image: codefreshplugins/cfstep-github-release
        environment:
          - GITHUB_TOKEN=${{GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          - FILES=bin/app-*
          - PRERELEASE=true
```
## Advanced usage

If one wants to do more actions to manage releases than just to create them, it is possible to override the behaviour with custom commands:

```
github_release_modify:
        image: codefreshplugins/cfstep-github-release
        commands:
          - github-release edit --user $CF_REPO_OWNER --repo $CF_REPO_NAME --tag $CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED --name "$CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED"
          - github-release delete --user $CF_REPO_OWNER --repo $CF_REPO_NAME --tag $CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED
          - github-release --help
```
